== Welcome to Meso Forge Mirror

Meso Forge Mirror is a Rust-based command-line tool designed to mirror conda packages from various sources to target repositories with full conda ecosystem integration through the rattler crates.

== Getting Started

If you're new to meso-forge-mirror, start with the link:operator-guide.adoc[Operator Guide] which provides comprehensive instructions for installation, configuration, and usage.

== Documentation Index

=== Core Documentation

High-level summary of the rattler ecosystem integration benefits:

* Before/after comparisons of functionality
* Operational benefits for different user types
* Performance characteristics and migration path
* Future roadmap and enhancement plans

== Key Features

=== Enhanced Conda Package Processing
* Full integration with rattler ecosystem for proper package handling
* Automatic metadata extraction and validation
* Platform-aware package organization
* Comprehensive integrity verification with checksums

=== Repository Structure Management
* Conda-compliant repository structure with platform subdirectories
* Automatic generation of repodata.json files
* Native support for Rattler cache directories
* S3/MinIO and prefix.dev integration

=== Operational Excellence
* Enhanced error handling and diagnostics
* Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
* Backward compatibility with existing workflows
* Robust validation pipeline for package integrity

== Quick Start

For immediate usage, here's a basic example of mirroring packages to the Rattler cache:

[source,bash]
----
# Mirror packages directly to rattler cache
meso-forge-mirror mirror \
  --sources "https://example.com/package1.conda,https://example.com/package2.conda" \
  --target-type local \
  --target-path ~/.cache/rattler/cache/pkgs/
----

== Architecture Overview

The tool is built with a modular architecture leveraging the rattler ecosystem:

* **Core Processing**: Integration with `rattler_conda_types` for type-safe conda operations
* **Package Streaming**: Uses `rattler_package_streaming` for efficient package processing
* **Platform Detection**: Leverages `rattler_virtual_packages` for accurate platform identification
* **Repository Management**: Custom implementation with conda ecosystem compatibility

== Support and Contributing

=== Getting Help
* Check the link:operator-guide.adoc#troubleshooting[troubleshooting section] for common issues
* Review the link:changelog-rattler-integration.adoc[changelog] for recent changes
* Enable debug logging with `RUST_LOG=debug` for detailed diagnostics

=== Contributing
Contributions are welcome! The tool is open source and follows standard Rust development practices:

* Unit tests for core functionality
* Integration tests for real-world scenarios
* Comprehensive documentation and examples
* Type-safe error handling throughout

== Version Information

This documentation covers meso-forge-mirror version 0.2.0 with rattler ecosystem integration.
